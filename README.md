# mobilePCD - Real-Time Pitch Class Distribution Analyzer

A web-based real-time audio analyzer that visualizes pitch class distribution (PCD) in a circular format with an integrated precision tuning needle. Perfect for musicians, music educators, and audio analysis enthusiasts.

## üéµ Features

### Visual Components
- **Circular PCD Ring**: 12-segment chromatic wheel showing real-time pitch class energy distribution
- **Interactive Rotation**: Touch/drag to rotate the ring for preferred orientation (reset with "Reset ring" button)
- **Precision Tuning Needle**: Shows the dominant frequency with smooth tracking and cent deviation display
- **Color-Coded Layout**: Each pitch class has its own color with visual distinction for black keys (sharps/flats)

### Audio Processing
- **High-Resolution FFT**: 16,384-sample window with 4,096-sample hop for excellent frequency resolution
- **Real-Time Analysis**: WebAudio API with AudioWorklet for low-latency processing
- **Smart Peak Detection**: Parabolic interpolation for sub-bin frequency accuracy
- **Prominence Filtering**: Configurable minimum peak prominence to ignore noise

### Tuning System
- **Configurable A4 Reference**: Default 440 Hz (standard concert pitch)
- **Cent Precision**: Shows deviation in cents (¬±50¬¢ range around nearest semitone)
- **Smoothed Response**: EMA filtering prevents jittery needle movement
- **Noise Gating**: RMS threshold to ignore quiet background noise

### User Controls
- **Reactivity Slider** (0.05-1.00): Controls needle smoothing - lower = smoother, higher = more responsive
- **Min Prominence** (0-24 dB): Minimum peak prominence required to show tuning needle
- **Min RMS** (0-0.02): Noise gate threshold to filter out quiet frames

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start Analysis**: Click "Start mic" to begin real-time audio capture
2. **Play/Sing**: The ring will show energy distribution across all 12 pitch classes
3. **Tune Instruments**: The blue needle points to the dominant frequency with cent deviation
4. **Adjust Settings**: Fine-tune reactivity, prominence, and noise gate as needed
5. **Rotate View**: Drag the ring to orient your preferred note at 12 o'clock
